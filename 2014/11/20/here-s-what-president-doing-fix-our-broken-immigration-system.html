<p>As everyone knows, our immigration system has been broken for decades, and the President is doing his job to address the problems that he can with his executive authority. He will continue to work with Congress to pass comprehensive and common-sense immigration reform that will offer a long-term and much-needed solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what exactly is the President&#39;s plan for immigration? Take a look at what the President plans to do:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every U.S. president since President Eisenhower has used his executive authority to address immigration issues. However, President Obama cannot fix the system on his own -- Congress must pass comprehensive immigration reform in order to enact a long-term solution. The U.S. Senate passed a bipartisan immigration bill more than 500 days ago, but House Republicans are still refusing to bring it up for a vote.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The President is doing his job, and it&#39;s time for Republicans in Congress to do theirs so we can build a system that lives up to our history as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.&nbsp;</p>
