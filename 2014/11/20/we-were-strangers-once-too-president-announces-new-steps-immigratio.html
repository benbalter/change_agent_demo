<p>&quot;Scripture tells us that we shall not oppress a stranger, for we know the heart of a stranger -- we were strangers once, too.&nbsp;My fellow Americans, we are and always will be a nation of immigrants. We were strangers once, too.&quot;</p>
<p class="rteright">-- President Obama, November 20, 2014</p>
<p>Since the founding of our nation, we&#39;ve weaved a tradition of welcoming immigrants into the very fabric of who we are. It&#39;s what keeps us dynamic, entrepreneurial, and uniquely American.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, as we know all too well, America&#39;s immigration system is broken. So tonight, President Obama addressed the nation on the executive actions he is taking to help fix what he can:</p>
<p>1. We will build on our progress at the border with additional resources for our law enforcement personnel.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, we have more agents and technology deployed to secure our southern border than at any time in our history. And over the past six years, illegal border crossings have been cut by more than half. Although this summer, there was a brief spike in unaccompanied children being apprehended at our border, the number of such children is now actually lower than it&rsquo;s been in nearly two years. Overall, the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is at its lowest level since the 1970s.&nbsp; Those are the facts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2.&nbsp;We will make it easier and faster for high-skilled immigrants, graduates, and entrepreneurs to stay and contribute to our economy, as so many business leaders have proposed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. We will take steps to deal responsibly with the millions of undocumented immigrants who already live in our country.</p>
