<p>In this week&rsquo;s address, the President laid out the steps he took this past week to fix our broken immigration system. Enacted within his legal authority, the President&rsquo;s plan focuses on cracking down on illegal immigration at the border; deporting felons, not families; and accountability through criminal background checks and taxes. These are commonsense steps, but only Congress can finish the job.</p>
<p>As the President acts, he&rsquo;ll continue to work with Congress on a comprehensive, bipartisan bill -- like the one passed by the Senate more than a year ago -- that can replace these actions and fix the whole system.</p>
