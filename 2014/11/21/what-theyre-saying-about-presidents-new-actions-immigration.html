<p>Last night, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/11/20/we-were-strangers-once-too-president-announces-new-steps-immigratio">President Obama addressed the nation</a> and laid out the steps he&#39;ll be taking -- within his executive authority as President -- to start fixing America&#39;s broken immigration system:</p>
<ol>
<li>
		Building on our progress at the border with additional resources for our law enforcement personnel.</li>
<li>
		Making it easier and faster for high-skilled immigrants, graduates, and entrepreneurs to stay and contribute to our economy, as many business leaders have proposed.</li>
<li>
		Dealing responsibly with the millions of undocumented immigrants who already live in our country.</li>
</ol>
<p>&quot;I continue to believe that the best way to solve this problem is by working together to pass that kind of common-sense law,&quot; the President said. He noted, however, that House Republicans continue to block a bipartisan immigration bill that the Senate passed a year and a half ago.</p>
<p>&quot;To those Members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed,&quot; he said, &quot;I have one answer: Pass a bill.&quot;</p>

<p>Already, a number of people -- ranging from prominent politicians and members of Congress to media personalities and other organizations -- have voiced their strong support for the President&#39;s action. Take a look what they had to say on Twitter:</p>
