<p>In an address to the nation last night, President Obama <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/immigration-action">announced new steps</a> he&rsquo;s taking to fix our broken immigration system and ensure nearly 5 million people will be held accountable and have the opportunity to play by the rules.</p>
<p>Using his executive authority, the President is making it easier for high-skilled immigrants and entrepreneurs to stay and contribute to the economy, as well as allowing certain undocumented immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for more than five years to get right by the law.</p>
<p>Alongside those steps, the President is also continuing to strengthen our border security. In fact, the Obama administration&rsquo;s investment in border technology, manpower, and resources represents the most serious and sustained action to secure our border in our nation&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>Today, there are more than 18,000 border patrol agents at our southwest border alone, the miles of fencing and barriers have more than doubled, unmanned aircraft systems have more than doubled, and ground surveillance has almost doubled -- making our border more secure than it has been in decades.</p>
<p>As a result of the President&rsquo;s focus on security over the past six years, illegal border crossings have been cut by more than half. Check out this chart to see how the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is at its lowest level since the 1970s:</p>
