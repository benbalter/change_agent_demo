<p>America has developed a wide number of social innovations that have matured from novel experiments into best practices for healthy societies.&nbsp; We pioneered new approaches to charitable giving such as the community foundation.&nbsp; We developed national service into a standard rite for youth development.&nbsp; But in just a few short years, #GivingTuesday has emerged as a potent new model of online and offline engagement that was pioneered in our country but has taken root around the world.</p>

<p>Since it launched in 2012, #GivingTuesday has become a case study in community organizing in the 21st century.&nbsp; It follows the consumer traditions of Black&nbsp;Friday and Cyber Monday on the public calendar. But, unlike these commercial counterparts, #GivingTuesday offers a moment on the calendar to encourage Americans to reflect and give back. &nbsp;Some might choose to volunteer their talent, others might make charitable contributions and still others simply to connect with friends and loved ones.&nbsp; Through millions of online clicks and offline acts, we expect #GivingTuesday will take many forms, but all will be energized by a common impulse to make life better, especially for those in need.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exciting that the #GivingTuesday organizers have exceeded the heights achieved in prior years. &nbsp;In 2015, it will take place through more than 18,000 partner organizations spread across all 50 states.&nbsp; It will involve 40 local communities who are developing their own unique campaigns to motivate and organize local citizens on making a difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, #GivingTuesday also could be described as #GlobalTuesday in 2015 because it is reaching beyond our borders. &nbsp;This year, the event will encompass citizens of dozens of countries around the world who are customizing their initiatives to their cultural norms and local needs. &nbsp;So, without regard to ethnicity, nationality, faith or political affiliation, millions are poised to be engaged in this worldwide moment.</p>
<p>Here at the White House, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/emessage_givingtuesday.pdf">President Obama is proud to celebrate this American innovation </a>that is creating world changing impact.</p>
<p>So now our question is &ndash; how will you celebrate&nbsp;<a href="http://givingtuesday.org/">#GivingTuesday</a>?</p>
