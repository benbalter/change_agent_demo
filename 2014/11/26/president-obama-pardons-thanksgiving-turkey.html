<p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/11/23/definitive-history-presidential-turkey-pardon">Since 1947</a>, the chairman of the National Turkey Federation has presented a turkey to the President. Each Thanksgiving, the President &ldquo;pardons&rdquo; that turkey, ensuring that the bird gets to spend the rest of its days living on a farm in Virginia. <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/26/remarks-president-pardoning-national-turkey">Today, President Obama celebrated</a> the 67th anniversary of the National Thanksgiving Turkey presentation by pardoning two 20-week old, 48-pound turkeys. And just like last year, the American public decided which of the two turkeys &ndash; Mac or Cheese &ndash; would become the National Thanksgiving Turkey by casting a vote for #TeamMac or #TeamCheese online.</p>
