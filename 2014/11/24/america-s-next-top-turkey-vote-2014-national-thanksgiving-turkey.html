<p>On Wednesday, November 26th, President Obama will announce the National Thanksgiving Turkey and, once again, we&rsquo;re inviting the American people to decide which bird takes the title.</p>
<p>Since <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/11/23/definitive-history-presidential-turkey-pardon">at least the 19th century</a>, Americans have been sending turkeys to the President for the holidays. As part of a more recent tradition that began in 2012, the National Thanksgiving Turkey will be chosen by the public through an online vote. This year&rsquo;s top turkeys, Mac and Cheese, are going beak-to-beak on Twitter -- and it&#39;s up to you to decide who will be America&#39;s next top turkey.</p>
<p>Mac and Cheese flock from Cooper Farms in Oakwood, Ohio. Mac&#39;s got a grand champion style strut and his gobble has a country ring to it. Cheese is a feather-shaker with a rhythmic gobble&nbsp;that&nbsp;loves to cheese it up for the the cameras.</p>
<p>Which turkey has what it takes? </p>
