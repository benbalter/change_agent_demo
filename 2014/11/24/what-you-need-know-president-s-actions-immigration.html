<p>Everyone knows that our immigration system has been broken for decades. So, like many presidents before him, President Obama is taking new steps to do what he can to fix the system while the country waits for Republicans to Congress to act.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
	1. So what are the actions the President is taking?&nbsp;</h3>
<p>President Obama is using his executive authority to fix as much of the broken system as he can, and ensure that everyone is held accountable and has the opportunity to play by the rules and contribute to the United States. You can read the full details of the plan <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/share/infographic-president-obama-taking-steps-fix-our-broken-immigration-system">here</a>, but here&#39;s a breakdown of what the President&rsquo;s plan will do:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
		Continue to strengthen our border security by deploying more resources to bolster enforcement</li>
<li>
		Make it easier and faster for high-skilled immigrants, graduates, and entrepreneurs to stay and contribute to our economy</li>
<li>
		Hold more than 4 million undocumented immigrants accountable if they want to temporarily stay in the United States</li>
</ul>
<p>For undocumented immigrants who are living in our country illegally, this is the deal: If you&rsquo;ve been in America for more than five years; if you have children who are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents; if you pass a criminal background check, you&rsquo;ll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily without fear of deportation and be required to pay taxes.&nbsp;</p>
