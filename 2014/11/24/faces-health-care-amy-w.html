	&quot;My husband and I own and operate a semi-truck. For the past 3 years, we have been paying $1200 a month for health coverage. Under the ACA exchanges, we found a plan with the same insurer for $89. Plus our deductible went from $10,000 to $300! That is a huge savings!&quot;</h2>

<p>Amy and her husband are self-employed, operating a semi-truck out of Augusta, GA. As self-employed Americans, they had to purchase health insurance on their own. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, they were able to keep a significant amount of their business profits in their pocket by purchasing an affordable, quality plan on the Health Insurance Marketplace.</p>
<p>Now Amy has another job -- helping others just like her get covered. By working with organizations, calling into radio shows, and spreading the word on Facebook, she helps answer questions people have and directs them to where they need to go for more information: HealthCare.gov. &quot;We have made a difference,&quot; she says.&nbsp;</p>
