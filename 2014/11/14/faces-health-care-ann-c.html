<h2>
	&quot;I was finally able to have a physical and a gynecological check-up, which included a mammogram. The mammogram showed an irregularity ... The cancer has been detected at a very early stage, which, with a 98% survival rate, has saved my life!&quot;</h2>
<p>Ann, a 51-year old mother of three, is a licensed massage therapist from Westport, CT who is dedicated to healing others. As a self-employed single mother, she could not afford health insurance. But when the Health Care Marketplace opened for all Americans last year, she found out that she qualified for Medicaid in her state. That coverage finally gave her the opportunity to see a doctor -- and catch her breast cancer very early.</p>
<p>She will have minor surgery to remove the irregularity and now has an almost 100% chance of survival. What&#39;s more, the cost of the screening and minor procedure will be far less than treating a more developed cancer down the line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to HealthCare.gov, she got the care she needed when she needed it most.&nbsp;</p>
