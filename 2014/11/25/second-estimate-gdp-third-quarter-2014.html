<p>Today&rsquo;s upward revision affirms that economic growth in the third quarter was strong, consistent with a broad range of other indicators showing improvement in the labor market, increasing domestic energy security, and continued low health cost growth. Since the financial crisis, the U.S. economy has bounced back more strongly than most others around the world, and the recent data highlight that the United States is continuing to lead the global recovery. Nevertheless, there is more work to be done to boost growth in the United States and around the world. The President&rsquo;s common-sense administrative actions on immigration&mdash;which CEA estimates will raise GDP by at least 0.4 percent over 10 years&mdash;will contribute to this effort, but only Congress can finish the job and make progress on other important steps like increased infrastructure investment.</p>
<p>FIVE KEY POINTS IN TODAY&rsquo;S REPORT FROM THE BUREAU OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS</p>
<p>1. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew 3.9 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter of 2014, according to the second estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The solid growth recorded in each of the last two quarters suggests that the economy has bounced back strongly from the first-quarter decline in GDP, which largely reflected transitory factors like unusually severe winter weather and a sharp slowdown in inventory investment. In the third quarter, net exports made a large positive contribution to growth, while consumer spending and business investment remained positive contributors but grew at a somewhat slower pace than the previous quarter. Real gross domestic income (GDI), an alternative measure of the overall size of the economy, was up 4.5 percent in Q3.</p>
