<p>This afternoon, President Obama traveled back to his hometown of Chicago to meet with civic and business leaders and detail the reasons he&#39;s acting on his own to help fix our broken immigration system.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/25/remarks-president-immigration-chicago-il">Speaking from a Polish community center in Chicago</a>, the President reminded us that every president since Eisenhower has used his executive authority to address immigration issues. In fact, every president for the last 50 years has taken action to keep families together and help improve our nation&#39;s immigration system.</p>
