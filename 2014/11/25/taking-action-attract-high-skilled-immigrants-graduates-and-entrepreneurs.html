<p>The President is taking action, within his legal authority, to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/immigration/immigration-action">fix our broken immigration system</a>. America needs a 21st century immigration system that lives up to our heritage as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants -- and that grows our economy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/11/21/fact-sheet-economic-benefits-fixing-our-broken-immigration-system">According to an analysis</a> by the President&rsquo;s Council of Economic Advisers, the President&rsquo;s executive actions on immigration stand to boost the nation&rsquo;s GDP by $90 billion to $210 billion, while shrinking the Federal deficit by $25 billion over the next ten years. These actions will also increase the productivity and wages of all American workers, not just immigrants.</p>
<p>Many of these economic benefits spring from the President&rsquo;s actions to &ldquo;make it easier and faster for high-skilled immigrants, graduates, and entrepreneurs to stay and contribute to our economy.&rdquo; We need to build on our strengths -- after all, over one-quarter of all U.S.-based Nobel laureates over the past 50 years were foreign-born, and more than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or children of immigrants.</p>
